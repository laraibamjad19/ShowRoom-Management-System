# ShowRoom-Management-System

Car dealerships in Pakistan are now digitalizing their record-keeping system. For decades, they have been maintaining a filing system in the form of hard copies. It becomes tedious to do so, and it is a big problem if a record gets missing or misplaced. Our client has asked us to implement a system that keeps all the details related to the vehicles the car dealership sells. Different types of cars are sold at the dealership in different colors and specifications. Furthermore, the car dealership sells selective parts of the vehicles that are authorized by the company. The database we will implement will have all the details on the parts. The admin will get to remove or add items and increase or decrease the number of items. The availability of the items will be added to the database. A desktop application will help the manager to keep records on the vehicles and the part and manage the system smoothly. Moreover, this system will decrease the probability of error.
